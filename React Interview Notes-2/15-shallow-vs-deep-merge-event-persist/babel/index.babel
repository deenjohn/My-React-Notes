//When you call setState, whether you call it with an object or in the functional form, the result is that
// it will shallow merge the properties in your object with the curren state. 

//this.setState({ selected: { ...this.state.selected, name: 'barfoo' } })
//which gets translated to this.setState({ selected: _extends({}, this.state.selected, { name: 'barfoo' }) }); 




class CountingParent extends React.Component {
  state = {
    actionCount: 0
  }

 handleReset = (e) => {
    e.persist()
   //without event persist , nativeEvent is set to null
   //The SyntheticEvent object is pooled for performance. 
   // Instead of creating a new one for every event, React replaces thecontents of the one single instance
    console.log('Child says', e);
  // actionCount is incremented, and
  // the new count replaces the existing one
    this.setState({
      actionCount: 0
    });
  }
 
  handleAction = (e) => {
    console.log('Child says', e.target.value);
  // actionCount is incremented, and
  // the new count replaces the existing one
    this.setState({
      actionCount: this.state.actionCount + 1
    });
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <Child onAction={this.handleAction}/>
        <button onClick={this.handleReset}>
           Reset
        </button>
        <p style ={{backgroundColor : 'blue' , width: 300 ,marginTop:5}}>Clicked {this.state.actionCount} times</p>

//Note that every instance of a component has its own state. If you have two CountingParent components
//on the page, theyâ€™ll each have counters that will start at 0 and //increment independently
